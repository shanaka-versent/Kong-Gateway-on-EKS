# AWS EKS with Kong Gateway as a K8s Gateway API Implementation with API Management

This POC demonstrates how to implement the Kubernetes Gateway API on AWS EKS using **Kong Gateway Enterprise**, integrated with **Kong Konnect** for centralized API management, analytics, and developer portal.

Both Istio and Kong implement the **Kubernetes Gateway API** standard for north-south traffic routing into the cluster. The key difference is what each brings beyond basic ingress:

- **Istio Gateway** implements the K8s Gateway API (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) to handle north-south traffic routing. Separately, Istio also provides a service mesh for east-west (service-to-service) traffic — but using Istio as a Gateway API implementation does not require enabling mesh features.
- **Kong Gateway** implements the same K8s Gateway API standard, but additionally provides **full API management capabilities** built into the gateway itself — rate limiting, authentication (JWT, OAuth, OIDC), request transformations, a developer portal, and 200+ plugins. When connected to **Kong Konnect**, it adds centralized analytics, a developer portal, and SaaS-based management.

In short: Istio Gateway gives you K8s Gateway API routing. Kong Gateway gives you K8s Gateway API routing **plus** API management — without needing a separate API gateway service.

> **Licensing:** This project uses **Kong Gateway Enterprise** (`kong/kong-gateway` image) with licensing automatically managed by Kong Konnect. A [free trial](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register) gives you 30 days of full Enterprise functionality. An [OSS alternative](#alternative-kong-gateway-oss-without-konnect) is available if you don't have a Konnect subscription.

This is particularly relevant for teams who:
- Need full API management (rate limiting, authentication, developer portal) built into the K8s Gateway API implementation — not as a separate service
- Want a single component that handles both ingress routing and API gateway concerns
- Are already using or evaluating Kong for API management
- Need to expose both APIs and web applications through the same gateway

## Reference Architecture (Common Pattern)

All implementations in this series follow a common reference architecture. The pattern is **cloud-agnostic** and applies to both AWS (CloudFront) and Azure (Front Door).

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart TB
    Client["Client"]

    subgraph Edge["Edge / CDN Layer"]
        CDN["CDN + WAF"]
    end

    subgraph Private["Private Connectivity"]
        PL["Private Link / VPC Origin"]
    end

    subgraph Cloud["Cloud VPC / VNet — Private Subnets"]
        ILB["Internal Load Balancer"]

        subgraph K8s["Kubernetes Cluster"]
            APIGW["API Gateway"]
            GW["K8s Gateway API"]
            SVC["Backend Services"]
        end
    end

    Client --> CDN
    CDN --> PL
    PL --> ILB
    ILB --> APIGW
    APIGW --> GW
    GW --> SVC
```

| Layer | Responsibility | Cloud Agnostic |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **CDN + WAF** | DDoS protection, geo-blocking, TLS termination, WAF rules (SQLi, XSS, rate limiting) | AWS CloudFront / Azure Front Door |
| **Private Connectivity** | End-to-end private path from edge to VPC — no public endpoints | AWS VPC Origin / Azure Private Link |
| **Internal Load Balancer** | L4 load balancing in private subnets, health checks | AWS NLB / Azure Internal LB |
| **API Gateway Capability** | Auth, rate limiting, request transforms, API key management | Kong, AWS API GW, or built into K8s GW |
| **K8s Gateway API** | Path-based routing via HTTPRoute CRDs, namespace isolation | Kong GatewayClass, Istio GatewayClass |
| **Backend Services** | Application workloads (APIs, web apps, microservices) | K8s Deployments + Services |

> **Key Security Property:** The Internal Load Balancer has NO public endpoint. Private connectivity from the CDN uses AWS-managed ENIs (VPC Origin) or Azure Private Endpoints. **It is impossible to bypass the CDN/WAF layer.**

### Where Does the API Gateway Capability Sit?

The key architectural decision across implementations is **where the API Gateway capability lives**:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart TB
    subgraph Impl1["Implementation 1: Kong Gateway"]
        direction LR
        A1["CDN + WAF"] --> B1["Internal LB"] --> C1["Kong Gateway"] --> D1["Backend Services"]

        A2["CDN + WAF"] --> B2["AWS API GW"] --> C2["Internal LB"] --> D2["K8s Gateway API"] --> E2["Backend Services"]
    end
```

| | Implementation 1: Kong | Implementation 2: AWS API GW |
|---|---|---|
| **API Gateway** | Kong Gateway (inside K8s) | AWS API Gateway (outside K8s) |
| **K8s Routing** | Kong IS the Gateway API impl | Istio or Kong (routing only) |
| **Traffic Split** | Single path for all traffic | Separate paths for Web vs API |
| **API Management** | Kong Plugins (200+) | API GW features + Lambda Authorizer |
| **Private Connectivity** | VPC Origin to NLB | VPC Link to NLB |

---

## Implementation 1: Kong Gateway (This Repo)

Kong Gateway serves as BOTH the API Gateway and the Kubernetes Gateway API implementation. All traffic (web + API) flows through a single path.

    end

    R1 --> App1
    R2 --> App2
    R3 --> API
    R4 --> Health
    Kong -.-> Konnect
```

**Traffic Flow:**
```
Client --> CloudFront + WAF --> VPC Origin --> Internal NLB --> Kong Gateway --> HTTPRoutes --> Backend Services
```

**Why this pattern:**
- Kong Gateway handles API management (auth, rate limiting, transforms) AND K8s routing in a single component
- No need for a separate AWS API Gateway service — Kong replaces it
- Single traffic path for both web content and APIs
- Kong Konnect provides analytics, developer portal, and centralized management as SaaS

## How Kong Implements the Kubernetes Gateway API

Kong Gateway implements the Kubernetes Gateway API **exactly like Istio does**. The architecture is directly comparable:

| Component | Istio | Kong |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Controller** (watches Gateway API resources) | Istiod | Kong Ingress Controller (KIC) |
| **Data Plane** (processes traffic) | Envoy Proxy | Kong Gateway |
| **GatewayClass controllerName** | `gateway.istio.io/gateway-controller` | `konghq.com/kic-gateway-controller` |

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
    subgraph KongImpl["Kong Gateway API Implementation"]
        direction LR
        KIC["Kong Ingress Controller"]
        KG["Kong Gateway Pods"]
    end

    GC["GatewayClass"]
    GW["Gateway"]
    HR["HTTPRoute"]
    SVC["Backend Services"]

    GC --> KIC
    GW --> KIC
    HR --> KIC
    KIC -->|"configures"| KG
    KG -->|"routes to"| SVC
```

**Key resources in this project:**
- **GatewayClass** (`k8s/kong/gateway-class.yaml`): Registers Kong as the Gateway API implementation
- **Gateway** (`k8s/kong/gateway.yaml`): Creates the Kong Gateway instance listening on ports 80/443
- **HTTPRoute** resources (`k8s/apps/*/httproute.yaml`): Define path-based routing rules

> **Note:** This is the same Gateway API standard. If you've used Istio's Gateway API implementation, switching to Kong only requires changing the `gatewayClassName` — the HTTPRoute resources remain identical.

---

## Implementation 2: Istio + AWS API Gateway

AWS API Gateway handles API management as a managed service. Traffic is split — API requests go through API Gateway, web requests go directly to an ALB. Istio provides the K8s Gateway API implementation and service mesh (mTLS).

```mermaid

    end

    subgraph AWS["AWS Cloud"]
        subgraph APIPath["API Traffic Path"]

        end

                IstioGW["Istio Gateway"]
                HR2["HTTPRoutes"]
                Apps2["Backend Services"]
            end
        end

        subgraph S3Path["Static Assets"]
            S3["S3 + OAC"]
        end
    end

    Client --> CF
    CF --> WAF

    WAF --> APIGW
    APIGW --> Lambda
    APIGW --> VPCLink
    VPCLink --> NLB2

    WAF --> ALB
    ALB --> NLB2

    WAF --> S3

    NLB2 --> IstioGW
    IstioGW --> HR2
    HR2 --> Apps2
```

**Traffic Flows:**
```
API:    Client --> CloudFront + WAF --> AWS API Gateway --> VPC Link --> Internal NLB --> Istio Gateway --> Backend
Web:    Client --> CloudFront + WAF --> ALB --> Internal NLB --> Istio Gateway --> Backend
Static: Client --> CloudFront + WAF --> S3 (OAC)
```

**Why this pattern:**
- AWS API Gateway provides managed API features (throttling, API keys, usage plans, Lambda authorizers)
- Istio adds service mesh capabilities (mTLS, internal traffic policies, observability)
- Separate paths allow different caching and security policies per traffic type
- Best for teams already invested in AWS managed services

## Comparison: Implementation Trade-offs

| Aspect | Kong Gateway (Impl 1) | AWS API GW + Istio (Impl 2) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **API Gateway** | Kong (in-cluster) | AWS API Gateway (managed) |
| **K8s Gateway API** | Kong GatewayClass | Istio GatewayClass |
| **Service Mesh** | None (add Kong Mesh if needed) | Istio Ambient (mTLS, ztunnel) |
| **Traffic Paths** | Single (all through Kong) | Split (API vs Web vs Static) |
| **Private Connectivity** | VPC Origin (fully private) | VPC Link + ALB (ALB is public) |
| **Bypass Protection** | Impossible (no public LB) | Header validation (Lambda) |
| **Plugin Ecosystem** | 200+ Kong plugins | AWS-managed features |
| **Developer Portal** | Kong Konnect (SaaS) | Not built-in |
| **Operational Overhead** | Lower (single gateway) | Higher (API GW + ALB + Istio) |
| **Cost Model** | Kong license + compute | AWS API GW per-request pricing |
| **East-West Security** | None by default | Istio mTLS (built-in) |

---

## Kong Gateway vs Istio: When to Use Which?

| Aspect | Kong Gateway | Istio |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Primary Focus** | API Gateway (North-South) | Service Mesh (East-West + North-South) |
| **Architecture** | Edge proxy only | Sidecar or Ambient mesh |
| **API Management** | Built-in (auth, rate limiting, portal) | Limited |
| **Service-to-Service mTLS** | Requires Kong Mesh | Built-in |
| **Operational Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Resource Overhead** | Lower (edge only) | Higher (sidecars/ztunnel) |
| **Best For** | API-first, external consumers | Microservices security, observability |

**Choose Kong Gateway when:** You need strong API management at the edge, have external API consumers, want simpler operations, or don't need service mesh features.

**Choose Istio when:** You need service-to-service mTLS, internal traffic policies, or full mesh observability.

**You can use both together:** Kong at the edge for API management, Istio Ambient internally for service mesh.

## Defense in Depth

Security is applied at every layer. WAF handles infrastructure threats at the edge, Kong plugins handle application/API concerns inside the cluster.

```

| Layer | What | Example Threats Blocked |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| **Edge (WAF)** | AWS Managed Rules | SQL injection, XSS, known bad inputs, bot floods |
| **Network (NLB)** | Security Groups | Direct access bypass, unauthorized CIDR ranges |
| **Application (Kong)** | Plugins | Unauthenticated API calls, excessive per-consumer requests |
| **Workload (K8s)** | Pod Security | Container escape, privilege escalation, resource abuse |

## Kong Gateway Editions & Licensing

Kong Gateway comes in two editions. This project defaults to Enterprise via Konnect:

| | Kong Gateway Enterprise (Default) | Kong Gateway OSS (Alternative) |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker Image** | `kong/kong-gateway` | `kong/kong` |
| **License** | Automatically managed by Konnect | No license needed |
| **Enterprise Plugins** | OpenID Connect, OAuth2 Introspection, mTLS, Vault, OPA, etc. | Not available |
| **Analytics** | Konnect Observability (real-time dashboards) | Self-managed (Prometheus/Grafana) |
| **Developer Portal** | Built-in via Konnect | Not available |
| **Admin UI** | Kong Manager + Konnect Dashboard | Kong Manager (limited) |
| **Gateway API Support** | Full (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) | Full (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) |
| **Cost** | Free trial (30 days) → Plus or Enterprise tier | Free forever |

> **Recommendation:** Start with the [Konnect free trial](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register) to get Enterprise features with zero license management. See the [OSS alternative](#alternative-kong-gateway-oss-without-konnect) section if you prefer to run without Konnect.

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.5
- kubectl
- Helm 3.x
- Kong Konnect account ([free trial](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register) or paid subscription)

## Deployment Steps

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
    S1["1. Clone"] --> S2["2. Terraform\n(L1 & L2)"]
    S2 --> S3["3. kubeconfig"]
    S3 --> S4["4. Konnect Setup\n(L3 Pre-config)"]
    S4 --> S5["5. ArgoCD Deploy\n(L3 & L4)"]
    S5 --> S6["6. Verify"]
```

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanaka-versent/EKS-Kong-GatewayAPI-Demo.git
cd EKS-Kong-GatewayAPI-Demo
```

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure (Layers 1 & 2)

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init

# Deploy without CloudFront (basic setup)
terraform apply

# OR deploy with CloudFront + WAF + VPC Origin (production-ready)
terraform apply -var="enable_cloudfront=true"
```

> **Note:** When `enable_cloudfront=true`, Terraform creates the Internal NLB, CloudFront VPC Origin, and WAF. The VPC Origin can take 15+ minutes to deploy.

### Step 3: Configure kubectl

```bash
$(terraform output -raw eks_get_credentials_command)
```

### Step 4: Configure Kong Konnect Integration (Layer 3 Pre-config)

This step **must be completed before Step 5** (ArgoCD deployment). ArgoCD will deploy Kong Gateway Enterprise in Layer 3, and the Enterprise pods require:
- The `kong` namespace and `konnect-client-tls` secret to exist
- Helm values configured with the Konnect endpoints and Enterprise image
- The mTLS certificate registered with your Konnect Control Plane

Konnect automatically provisions the Enterprise license — no license file management required.

> **Don't have a Konnect account?** See the [OSS alternative](#alternative-kong-gateway-oss-without-konnect) to deploy without Konnect.

1. **Create a Control Plane in Konnect**
   - Sign in to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com)
   - In the left sidebar, click **API Gateway**
   - Click **+ New Control Plane** → choose **Kong Ingress Controller**
   - Name it (e.g., `eks-demo`) and save
   - Note the **Control Plane ID** from the overview page

2. **Generate mTLS Certificates**
   ```bash
   openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -subj "/CN=kongdp/C=US" \
     -keyout ./tls.key -out ./tls.crt -days 365
   ```

3. **Create TLS Secret in Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace kong
   kubectl create secret tls konnect-client-tls -n kong \
     --cert=./tls.crt \
     --key=./tls.key
   ```

4. **Register Certificate with Konnect**
   ```bash
   # Set your Konnect variables
   export KONNECT_REGION="us"          # us, eu, au, me, in, sg
   export KONNECT_TOKEN="kpat_xxx..."  # Personal access token from Konnect
   export CONTROL_PLANE_ID="your-cp-id-here"

   # Format certificate for API (remove newlines)
   CERT=$(awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' tls.crt)

   # Register the certificate with Konnect
   curl -X POST "https://${KONNECT_REGION}.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/${CONTROL_PLANE_ID}/dp-client-certificates" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN" \
     --json "{\"cert\": \"$CERT\"}"
   ```

5. **Update Helm Values**

   Update `k8s/kong/konnect-values.yaml` with your Konnect endpoints:
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: kong/kong-gateway   # Enterprise image (license via Konnect)
     tag: "3.9"

   ingressController:
     enabled: true
     konnect:
       enabled: true
       controlPlaneId: "<your-control-plane-id>"
       tlsClientCertSecretName: konnect-client-tls

   gateway:
     env:
       role: data_plane
       database: "off"
       konnect_mode: "on"
       vitals: "off"
       cluster_mtls: pki
       cluster_control_plane: "<your-cp>.us.cp0.konghq.com:443"
       cluster_server_name: "<your-cp>.us.cp0.konghq.com"
       cluster_telemetry_endpoint: "<your-tp>.us.tp0.konghq.com:443"
       cluster_telemetry_server_name: "<your-tp>.us.tp0.konghq.com"
       cluster_cert: /etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.crt
       cluster_cert_key: /etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.key
       lua_ssl_trusted_certificate: system

     secretVolumes:

   ```

#### Konnect Configuration Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `cluster_control_plane` | Control plane endpoint (host:port) | `example.us.cp0.konghq.com:443` |
| `cluster_server_name` | SNI for TLS connection to control plane | `example.us.cp0.konghq.com` |
| `cluster_telemetry_endpoint` | Telemetry endpoint for analytics | `example.us.tp0.konghq.com:443` |
| `cluster_telemetry_server_name` | SNI for telemetry TLS connection | `example.us.tp0.konghq.com` |
| `cluster_mtls` | mTLS mode (`pki` for Konnect) | `pki` |
| `cluster_cert` | Path to client certificate | `/etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.crt` |
| `cluster_cert_key` | Path to client private key | `/etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.key` |

### Step 5: Deploy Kong Gateway & Applications via ArgoCD (Layers 3 & 4)

ArgoCD now deploys Kong Gateway Enterprise (Layer 3) using the Konnect configuration from Step 4, followed by the application workloads (Layer 4).

```bash
# Get ArgoCD admin password
terraform output -raw argocd_admin_password

# Apply root application — this triggers Layer 3 (Kong Gateway) and Layer 4 (Apps)
kubectl apply -f argocd/apps/root-app.yaml

# Wait for all apps to sync
kubectl get applications -n argocd -w
```

> **What ArgoCD deploys in order:**
> 1. Gateway API CRDs
> 2. Kong Gateway Enterprise (using `konnect-values.yaml` with the Enterprise image and Konnect config)
> 3. GatewayClass + Gateway resources
> 4. Application workloads (app1, app2, users-api, health-responder) with HTTPRoutes

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

#### Verify Gateway API Resources

```bash
# Verify Kong Gateway pods are running
kubectl get pods -n kong

# Check GatewayClass status
kubectl get gatewayclass kong -o yaml

# Check Gateway status
kubectl get gateway kong-gateway -n kong -o yaml

# Verify HTTPRoutes are working
kubectl get httproutes -A
```

#### Verify Konnect Connection

1. **Check Data Plane Status in Konnect UI**
   - Go to Kong Konnect dashboard at [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com)
   - In the left sidebar, click **API Gateway**
   - Click on your Control Plane to open the Overview dashboard
   - Click **Data Plane Nodes** in the sidebar to see connected nodes
   - Your data plane node(s) should show status **"Connected"**
   - The Enterprise license is automatically applied — no manual license file needed
   
2. **Verify from Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   # Check Kong pod logs for successful Konnect connection
   kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong --tail=50 | grep -i konnect

   # Verify pods are running with Enterprise image
   kubectl get pods -n kong -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}'
   # Should show: kong/kong-gateway:3.9

   # Check for any connection errors
   kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong | grep -i "error\|failed"
   ```

3. **Verify Enterprise Features**
   - Analytics will start appearing in the Konnect dashboard within 1-2 minutes
   - Enterprise plugins (OpenID Connect, OPA, Vault, etc.) are now available
   - Configuration changes in Konnect UI sync to data planes within seconds

## Testing

### Test Endpoints

```bash
# When CloudFront is enabled, use the CloudFront URL:
CF_URL=$(cd terraform && terraform output -raw cloudfront_url)

# Test App 1 (no plugins)
curl ${CF_URL}/app1

# Test App 2 (no plugins)
curl ${CF_URL}/app2

# Test Users API (with rate limiting)
curl ${CF_URL}/api/users

# Test health endpoint
curl ${CF_URL}/healthz/ready

# Verify NLB target health (Kong pods should be healthy)
TG_ARN=$(cd terraform && terraform output -raw nlb_target_group_arn)
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn ${TG_ARN}

# Verify TargetGroupBinding
kubectl get targetgroupbindings -n kong
```

### Access ArgoCD UI

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
# Open https://localhost:8080
# Username: admin
# Password: terraform output -raw argocd_admin_password
```

## Alternative: Kong Gateway OSS (Without Konnect)

If you don't have a Kong Konnect subscription and don't need Enterprise features, you can deploy with the **open-source Kong Gateway** instead.

### What You Lose Without Konnect

| Feature | Enterprise (Konnect) | OSS |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| Enterprise plugins (OIDC, OPA, Vault, mTLS) | Yes | No |
| Centralized analytics dashboard | Yes | No — use Prometheus/Grafana |
| Developer Portal | Yes | No |
| Automatic license management | Yes | N/A |
| Kong Manager UI | Full | Limited |
| **Gateway API support** | **Full** | **Full** |
| **Core plugins (rate limiting, JWT, CORS, etc.)** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

### OSS Deployment Steps

**Skip Step 4** entirely (no Layer 3 pre-config needed) and make these changes:

1. **Use the OSS Helm values** (`k8s/kong/values.yaml` instead of `konnect-values.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: kong/kong    # OSS image (not kong/kong-gateway)
     tag: "3.9"

   ingressController:
     enabled: true
     # No konnect section needed

   gateway:
     env:
       database: "off"        # DB-less mode
       # No konnect_mode, cluster_*, or role settings needed
   ```

2. **Update the ArgoCD app** (`argocd/apps/02-kong-gateway.yaml`) to reference `values.yaml` instead of `konnect-values.yaml`

3. **Deploy Steps 1-3, then Step 5-6 directly** — ArgoCD will deploy Kong Gateway OSS without Konnect. No namespace or secret pre-creation needed since the OSS image doesn't require Konnect credentials

> **Note:** The Gateway API resources (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) work identically with both editions. Only the available plugin set and management capabilities differ.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Delete ArgoCD apps first
kubectl delete -f argocd/apps/root-app.yaml

# Wait for resources to be cleaned up
sleep 60

# Destroy infrastructure
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```
