# AWS EKS with Kong Gateway as a K8s Gateway API Implementation with API Management

This POC demonstrates how to implement the **Kubernetes Gateway API** on AWS EKS using **Kong Gateway Enterprise**, integrated with **Kong Konnect** for centralized API management, analytics, and developer portal.

## Background

My previous POCs implemented the Kubernetes Gateway API using Istio — on both [AWS EKS](https://github.com/shanaka-versent/EKS-Istio-GatewayAPI-Deom/tree/k8s-gateway-api-poc) and [Azure AKS](https://github.com/shanaka-versent/AKS-Istio-GatewayAPI-Demo/tree/k8s-gateway-api-poc). This POC explores Kong Gateway as an alternative Gateway API implementation and compares what each brings to the table.

Both Istio and Kong implement the **Kubernetes Gateway API** standard for north-south traffic routing into the cluster. The key difference is what each brings beyond basic ingress:

| Capability | Istio Gateway | Kong Gateway |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| K8s Gateway API (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) | Yes | Yes |
| API Management (rate limiting, auth, transforms) | No — requires a separate API gateway | Built-in (200+ plugins) |
| Service Mesh (east-west mTLS) | Yes (optional, independent of Gateway API) | No — not a service mesh |
| Developer Portal | No | Yes (via Kong Konnect) |
| Centralized Analytics | No | Yes (via Kong Konnect) |

In short: **Istio Gateway** gives you K8s Gateway API routing. **Kong Gateway** gives you K8s Gateway API routing **plus** API management — without needing a separate API gateway service.

## Key Architecture Decision — How to Deploy Kong for API Management

Before choosing a deployment model, it is important to understand how Kong Konnect configures gateways on Kubernetes — because a current platform limitation directly impacts the architecture.

### Kong Gateway Configuration Options on Kubernetes

When creating an API Gateway in Kong Konnect for Kubernetes, you are presented with three setup choices and one critical configuration decision:

**Where to run your gateway:** Self-managed (deploy anywhere), Serverless (learning and development), or Dedicated Cloud (enterprise-grade managed).

**How to run your gateway:** Docker, Linux binary, or Kubernetes.

**How to store your configuration (the critical choice):** This is where you choose the source of truth for your gateway configuration — also known as your control plane. This choice is **mutually exclusive and cannot be changed after creation**.

The screenshot below shows the Kong Konnect gateway creation screen as of February 2025:

![Kong Gateway Configuration Options — Konnect gateway creation showing the mutually exclusive choice between "Konnect as source" and "Kubernetes API server as source"](docs/images/Kong_Gateway_Configuration_Options.png)

As the built-in comparison table in the Konnect UI shows:

- **Konnect as source** (recommended by Kong) — Full UI/API configuration, Kubernetes CRDs, and Dev Portal. But **no Kubernetes Gateway API support**.
- **Kubernetes API server as source** (read-only in Konnect) — Full Kubernetes Gateway API support (`Gateway`, `HTTPRoute`, `GRPCRoute`). But Konnect becomes **read-only** — no UI configuration, no Dev Portal, no decK or Terraform management.

### The Limitation: You Cannot Have Both Today

**You cannot get full Konnect management AND Kubernetes Gateway API support in a single Kong Gateway instance.** This is a significant constraint for organisations that want:

- Kubernetes Gateway API compliance for cloud-native routing portability
- Full Konnect-managed API lifecycle management with UI access for API teams
- Dev Portal for API consumers
- Unified observability across all gateway layers

This limitation is expected to improve over time. As the Kubernetes Gateway API matures and becomes the de facto standard, Kong will almost certainly bring full Konnect management support — including Dev Portal, decK, Terraform, and UI-driven configuration — to Gateway API-configured gateways. When that happens, a single Kong Gateway instance could handle both API management and Kubernetes-native routing, simplifying architectures significantly.

However, as of February 2025, this trade-off exists and must be addressed architecturally.

### What This Means for Architecture

Given this limitation, there are two deployment models for using Kong as an API management layer. Each makes a different trade-off:

---

#### Option 1: Kong on K8s — Ingress (K8s Gateway API) + API Management (This Repo)

Kong is deployed **inside the EKS cluster** using **"Kubernetes API server as source"**. This means Kong serves as both the Kubernetes Gateway API implementation and the API management layer — handling ingress routing, authentication, rate limiting, and all API policies in one place.

**The trade-off:** Because the configuration source is the K8s API server, Konnect is **read-only**. You manage all configuration (routes, plugins, consumers) through Kubernetes CRDs and GitOps — not through the Konnect UI. You still get Konnect analytics and observability, but you lose UI-driven configuration, Dev Portal, and decK/Terraform Konnect provider support.

**What you get:**
- Single component for both Gateway API routing and API management
- Full Kubernetes Gateway API compliance (`Gateway`, `HTTPRoute`, `GRPCRoute`)
- All Kong plugins available (rate limiting, JWT, CORS, transforms, etc.) via KongPlugin CRDs
- Konnect analytics and data plane monitoring (read-only)
- GitOps-native configuration — everything is Kubernetes YAML

**What you lose (due to Konnect being read-only):**
- No UI-driven configuration from the Konnect dashboard
- No Dev Portal
- No decK or Terraform Konnect provider for gateway configuration
- Configuration management is purely through Kubernetes CRDs

**Choose this when:** Your APIs are primarily hosted on Kubernetes, your team is comfortable with GitOps-driven configuration, and you want a single in-cluster component for both routing and API management. This is the most operationally simple approach and avoids the cost of running a separate API management layer.

**Future consolidation:** When Kong brings full Konnect management to Gateway API-configured gateways, this option becomes the ideal single-gateway architecture — you would gain UI-driven configuration, Dev Portal, and decK/Terraform support without changing the deployment model.

> **This repo implements Option 1.** See the [Detailed Architecture](#detailed-architecture) section below for the full implementation.

---

#### Option 2: Kong External to K8s — Centralised API Management ([Covered in Appendix](#appendix-kong-as-an-external-api-management-layer) & Separate Repo)

Kong is deployed **outside the EKS cluster** (on EC2/ECS or as a Kong Konnect Dedicated Cloud Gateway) using **"Konnect as source"**. This gives you the full Konnect management experience — UI-driven configuration, Dev Portal, analytics, decK, and Terraform — but Kong does not implement the Kubernetes Gateway API. A separate Gateway API implementation (e.g., Istio Gateway) handles K8s routing inside the cluster.

**The trade-off:** You need two components — Kong for API management and Istio Gateway (or another Gateway API implementation) for Kubernetes-native routing. This adds an extra network hop and requires two observability stacks (Konnect for API metrics, Kiali/Grafana for Istio metrics).

**What you get:**
- Full Konnect UI/API management — configure plugins, consumers, rate limiting from the dashboard
- Dev Portal for API discovery and self-service consumer onboarding
- decK and Terraform Konnect provider for declarative API policy management
- Full analytics and real-time dashboards in Konnect
- Ability to manage APIs across multiple platforms (K8s, EC2, ECS, Lambda) through a single API management layer
- Kubernetes Gateway API compliance via Istio Gateway (or another implementation)

**What you lose:**
- Additional network hop (Kong → Istio Gateway → backend services)
- Two observability stacks to manage (Konnect + Kiali/Grafana)
- More complex deployment with more moving parts

**Choose this when:** You need full Konnect management capabilities (especially Dev Portal and UI-driven configuration), you have APIs across multiple platforms that need unified management, or you want to keep API management concerns fully separated from K8s cluster operations.

**Future consolidation:** When Kong matures its Gateway API support with full Konnect integration, you could move Kong into the cluster as a single gateway, removing the need for Istio Gateway and simplifying the architecture.

> **Option 2 is covered in the [Appendix](#appendix-kong-as-an-external-api-management-layer) below and in a separate repository:** [EKS-Kong-Istio-API-Management-Demo](https://github.com/shanaka-versent/EKS-Kong-Istio-API-Management-Demo) *(coming soon)*
>
> The Appendix details the architecture. The separate repo implements it, as described in the companion blog post: [Enterprise API Management on Amazon EKS: Kong Gateway with Istio Ambient Mesh](#).

### Quick Comparison

| | Option 1: Kong on K8s (This Repo) | Option 2: Kong External (Separate Repo) |
|---|---|---|
| **Kong config source** | K8s API server | Konnect |
| **K8s Gateway API** | ✅ Native | Via Istio Gateway |
| **Konnect UI management** | ❌ Read-only | ✅ Full |
| **Dev Portal** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **decK / Terraform** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Analytics** | ✅ Read-only | ✅ Full |
| **Components in cluster** | Kong only | Kong + Istio Gateway |
| **Network hops** | 1 (Kong → backend) | 2 (Kong → Istio GW → backend) |
| **Best for** | K8s-first, GitOps teams | Multi-platform, UI-driven teams |
| **Consolidation path** | Gains full Konnect when Kong adds support | Removes Istio Gateway when Kong adds support |

> **Note:** Both options use the same Kong Gateway Enterprise with the same plugin ecosystem. The difference is how configuration is managed and whether the Kubernetes Gateway API is handled by Kong directly or by a separate component.

---

> **Licensing:** This project uses **Kong Gateway Enterprise** (`kong/kong-gateway` image) with licensing automatically managed by Kong Konnect. A [free trial](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register) gives you 30 days of full Enterprise functionality. An [OSS alternative](#alternative-kong-gateway-oss-without-konnect) is available if you don't have a Konnect subscription.

## High-level Architecture

All implementations in this series follow a common reference architecture. The pattern is **cloud-agnostic** and applies to both AWS (CloudFront) and Azure (Front Door).

| **CDN + WAF** | DDoS protection, geo-blocking, TLS termination, WAF rules (SQLi, XSS, rate limiting) | AWS CloudFront / Azure Front Door |
| **Private Connectivity** | End-to-end private path from edge to VPC — no public endpoints | AWS VPC Origin / Azure Private Link |
| **Internal Load Balancer** | L4 load balancing in private subnets, health checks | AWS NLB / Azure Internal LB |
| **API Gateway Capability** | Auth, rate limiting, request transforms, API key management | Kong, AWS API GW, or built into K8s GW |
| **K8s Gateway API** | Path-based routing via HTTPRoute CRDs, namespace isolation | Kong GatewayClass, Istio GatewayClass |
| **Backend Services** | Application workloads (APIs, web apps, microservices) | K8s Deployments + Services |

> **Key Security Property:** The Internal Load Balancer has NO public endpoint. Private connectivity from the CDN uses AWS-managed ENIs (VPC Origin) or Azure Private Endpoints. **It is impossible to bypass the CDN/WAF layer.**

## Detailed Architecture

Kong Gateway serves as BOTH the API Gateway and the Kubernetes Gateway API implementation. All traffic (web + API) flows through a single path.

**Traffic Flow:**
```
Client → CloudFront + WAF (TLS) → VPC Origin → Internal NLB → Kong Gateway (TLS) → HTTPRoute → Backend Service
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Single traffic path** — all requests (web + API) flow through Kong Gateway, no split paths
- **Namespace isolation** — each tenant and the API have their own namespace with ReferenceGrant for cross-namespace routing
- **Plugins per-route** — only `/api/users` has rate limiting, request transforms, and CORS; tenant apps are clean pass-through
- **Terraform-managed NLB** — created before Kong deploys (avoids chicken-and-egg with CloudFront VPC Origin)
- **Kong Konnect** — telemetry and management via SaaS, no admin API exposed in-cluster

### Node Pool Layout

| Node Pool | Taint | Workloads |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| System Nodes | CriticalAddonsOnly | ArgoCD, Kong components, AWS LB Controller |
| User Nodes | None | Application workloads (app1, app2, users-api) |

---

## End-to-End Traffic Flow

The architecture implements **dual TLS termination** for end-to-end encryption, with fully private internal connectivity via VPC Origin (PrivateLink). No public endpoints are exposed inside the VPC.

### TLS Certificate Chain

## How Kong Implements the Kubernetes Gateway API

Kong Gateway implements the Kubernetes Gateway API **exactly like Istio does**. The architecture is directly comparable:

| Component | Istio | Kong |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Controller** (watches Gateway API resources) | Istiod | Kong Ingress Controller (KIC) |
| **Data Plane** (processes traffic) | Envoy Proxy | Kong Gateway |
| **GatewayClass controllerName** | `gateway.istio.io/gateway-controller` | `konghq.com/kic-gateway-controller` |

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
    subgraph KongImpl["Kong Gateway API Implementation"]
        direction LR

    SVC["Backend Services"]

    GC --> KIC
    GW --> KIC
    HR --> KIC
    KIC -->|"configures"| KG
    KG -->|"routes to"| SVC
```

**Key resources in this project:**
- **GatewayClass** (`k8s/kong/gateway-class.yaml`): Registers Kong as the Gateway API implementation
- **Gateway** (`k8s/kong/gateway.yaml`): Creates the Kong Gateway instance listening on ports 80/443
- **HTTPRoute** resources (`k8s/apps/*/httproute.yaml`): Define path-based routing rules

> **Note:** This is the same Gateway API standard. If you've used Istio's Gateway API implementation, switching to Kong only requires changing the `gatewayClassName` — the HTTPRoute resources remain identical.

> **Note:** API management (north-south) and service mesh (east-west) are complementary concerns. You can use Kong Gateway at the edge for API management and Istio Ambient internally for service-to-service mTLS — they work together.

## Security

Security is applied at every layer. WAF handles infrastructure threats at the edge, Kong plugins handle application/API concerns inside the cluster.

### Rate Limiting
```yaml

metadata:
  name: rate-limiting
config:
  minute: 100
  policy: local
  limit_by: ip

```yaml
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: jwt-auth
config:
  claims_to_verify:
  - exp
plugin: jwt
```

A demo consumer (`demo-user`) with HMAC-SHA256 credentials is deployed automatically via ArgoCD from `k8s/apps/api/jwt-auth.yaml`. Generate a test token with `./scripts/02-generate-jwt.sh`.

### CORS
```yaml
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: cors
config:
  origins: ["*"]
  methods: [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
plugin: cors
```

## Health Check Flow

NLB health probes target Kong's status endpoint directly. Application health checks route through Kong to the health-responder service:

    NLB -->|"/healthz/ready"| Kong
    Kong --> HR --> Health
    Health -->|"200 OK"| NLB
```

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.5
- kubectl
- Helm 3.x
- Kong Konnect account ([free trial](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register) or paid subscription)

## Deployment Steps

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
    S1["1. Clone"] --> S2["2. Terraform\n(L1 & L2)"]
    S2 --> S3["3. kubeconfig"]
    S3 --> S4["4. Konnect Setup\n(L3 Pre-config)"]
    S4 --> S5["5. ArgoCD Deploy\n(L3 & L4)"]
    S5 --> S6["6. Verify"]
```

### Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanaka-versent/EKS-Kong-GatewayAPI-Demo.git
cd EKS-Kong-GatewayAPI-Demo
```

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure (Layers 1 & 2)

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init

# Deploy without CloudFront (basic setup)
terraform apply

# OR deploy with CloudFront + WAF + VPC Origin (production-ready)
terraform apply -var="enable_cloudfront=true"
```

> **Note:** When `enable_cloudfront=true`, Terraform creates the Internal NLB, CloudFront VPC Origin, and WAF. The VPC Origin can take 15+ minutes to deploy.

### Step 3: Configure kubectl

```bash
$(terraform output -raw eks_get_credentials_command)
```

### Step 4: Configure Kong Konnect Integration (Layer 3 Pre-config)

This step **must be completed before Step 5** (ArgoCD deployment). ArgoCD will deploy Kong Gateway Enterprise in Layer 3, and the Enterprise pods require:
- The `kong` namespace with `konnect-client-tls` secret (Konnect mTLS) and `kong-gateway-tls` secret (end-to-end TLS)
- Helm values configured with the Konnect endpoints and Enterprise image
- The mTLS certificate registered with your Konnect Control Plane

Konnect automatically provisions the Enterprise license — no license file management required.

> **Don't have a Konnect account?** See the [OSS alternative](#alternative-kong-gateway-oss-without-konnect) to deploy without Konnect.

1. **Create a Control Plane in Konnect**
   - Sign in to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com)
   - In the left sidebar, click **Gateway Manager**
   - Click **[+ New Control Plane](https://cloud.konghq.com/gateway-manager/create-gateway)** → select **Kong Ingress Controller** as the control plane type
   - Name it (e.g., `eks-demo`) and click **Create**
   - Note the **Control Plane ID** from the overview page

2. **Generate Konnect mTLS Certificates**
   ```bash
   openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -subj "/CN=kongdp/C=US" \
     -keyout ./tls.key -out ./tls.crt -days 365
   ```

3. **Generate Gateway TLS Certificates (End-to-End TLS)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/01-generate-certs.sh
   ```

4. **Create TLS Secrets in Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace kong

   # Konnect mTLS secret
   kubectl create secret tls konnect-client-tls -n kong \
     --cert=./tls.crt \
     --key=./tls.key

   # Gateway TLS secret (for end-to-end encryption)
   kubectl create secret tls kong-gateway-tls -n kong \
     --cert=certs/server.crt \
     --key=certs/server.key
   ```

5. **Register Certificate with Konnect**
   ```bash
   # Set your Konnect variables
   export KONNECT_REGION="us"          # us, eu, au, me, in, sg
   export KONNECT_TOKEN="kpat_xxx..."  # Personal access token from Konnect
   export CONTROL_PLANE_ID="your-cp-id-here"

   # Format certificate for API (remove newlines)
   CERT=$(awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' tls.crt)

   # Register the certificate with Konnect
   curl -X POST "https://${KONNECT_REGION}.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/${CONTROL_PLANE_ID}/dp-client-certificates" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN" \
     --json "{\"cert\": \"$CERT\"}"
   ```

6. **Update Helm Values**

   Update `k8s/kong/konnect-values.yaml` with your Konnect endpoints:
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: kong/kong-gateway   # Enterprise image (license via Konnect)
     tag: "3.9"

   ingressController:
     enabled: true
     konnect:
       enabled: true
       controlPlaneId: "<your-control-plane-id>"
       tlsClientCertSecretName: konnect-client-tls

   gateway:
     env:
       role: data_plane
       database: "off"
       konnect_mode: "on"
       vitals: "off"
       cluster_mtls: pki
       cluster_control_plane: "<your-cp>.us.cp0.konghq.com:443"
       cluster_server_name: "<your-cp>.us.cp0.konghq.com"
       cluster_telemetry_endpoint: "<your-tp>.us.tp0.konghq.com:443"
       cluster_telemetry_server_name: "<your-tp>.us.tp0.konghq.com"
       cluster_cert: /etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.crt
       cluster_cert_key: /etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.key
       lua_ssl_trusted_certificate: system

     secretVolumes:
       - konnect-client-tls
   ```

#### Konnect Configuration Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `cluster_control_plane` | Control plane endpoint (host:port) | `example.us.cp0.konghq.com:443` |
| `cluster_server_name` | SNI for TLS connection to control plane | `example.us.cp0.konghq.com` |
| `cluster_telemetry_endpoint` | Telemetry endpoint for analytics | `example.us.tp0.konghq.com:443` |
| `cluster_telemetry_server_name` | SNI for telemetry TLS connection | `example.us.tp0.konghq.com` |
| `cluster_mtls` | mTLS mode (`pki` for Konnect) | `pki` |
| `cluster_cert` | Path to client certificate | `/etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.crt` |
| `cluster_cert_key` | Path to client private key | `/etc/secrets/konnect-client-tls/tls.key` |

### Step 5: Deploy Kong Gateway & Applications via ArgoCD (Layers 3 & 4)

ArgoCD now deploys Kong Gateway Enterprise (Layer 3) using the Konnect configuration from Step 4, followed by the application workloads (Layer 4).

```bash
# Get ArgoCD admin password
terraform output -raw argocd_admin_password

# Apply root application — this triggers Layer 3 (Kong Gateway) and Layer 4 (Apps)
kubectl apply -f argocd/apps/root-app.yaml

# Wait for all apps to sync
kubectl get applications -n argocd -w
```

> **What ArgoCD deploys in order:**
> 1. Gateway API CRDs
> 2. Kong Gateway Enterprise (using `konnect-values.yaml` with the Enterprise image and Konnect config)
> 3. GatewayClass + Gateway resources
> 4. Application workloads (app1, app2, users-api, health-responder) with HTTPRoutes

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

#### Verify Gateway API Resources

```bash
# Verify Kong Gateway pods are running
kubectl get pods -n kong

# Check GatewayClass status
kubectl get gatewayclass kong -o yaml

# Check Gateway status
kubectl get gateway kong-gateway -n kong -o yaml

# Verify HTTPRoutes are working
kubectl get httproutes -A
```

#### Verify Konnect Connection

1. **Check Data Plane Status in Konnect UI**
   - Go to Kong Konnect dashboard at [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com)
   - In the left sidebar, click **Gateway Manager**
   - Click on your Control Plane to open the Overview dashboard
   - Click **Data Plane Nodes** in the sidebar to see connected nodes
   - Your data plane node(s) should show status **"Connected"**
   - The Enterprise license is automatically applied — no manual license file needed
   
2. **Verify from Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   # Check Kong pod logs for successful Konnect connection
   kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong --tail=50 | grep -i konnect

   # Verify pods are running with Enterprise image
   kubectl get pods -n kong -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}'
   # Should show: kong/kong-gateway:3.9

   # Check for any connection errors
   kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong | grep -i "error\|failed"
   ```

3. **Verify Enterprise Features**
   - Analytics will start appearing in the Konnect dashboard within 1-2 minutes
   - Enterprise plugins (OpenID Connect, OPA, Vault, etc.) are now available
   - Configuration changes in Konnect UI sync to data planes within seconds

## Testing

### Test Endpoints

```bash
# When CloudFront is enabled, use the CloudFront URL:
CF_URL=$(cd terraform && terraform output -raw cloudfront_url)

# Test App 1 (no plugins)
curl ${CF_URL}/app1

# Test App 2 (no plugins)
curl ${CF_URL}/app2

# Test Users API - without token (expect 401 Unauthorized)
curl -i ${CF_URL}/api/users

# Generate a JWT token for the demo-user consumer
TOKEN=$(./scripts/02-generate-jwt.sh | grep -A1 "^Token:" | tail -1)

# Test Users API - with valid token (expect 200 OK)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" ${CF_URL}/api/users

# Test health endpoint
curl ${CF_URL}/healthz/ready

# Verify NLB target health (Kong pods should be healthy)
TG_ARN=$(cd terraform && terraform output -raw nlb_target_group_arn)
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn ${TG_ARN}

# Verify TargetGroupBinding
kubectl get targetgroupbindings -n kong
```

### Access ArgoCD UI

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
# Open https://localhost:8080
# Username: admin
# Password: terraform output -raw argocd_admin_password
```

## Alternative: Kong Gateway OSS (Without Konnect)

If you don't have a Kong Konnect subscription and don't need Enterprise features, you can deploy with the **open-source Kong Gateway** instead.

### What You Lose Without Konnect

| Feature | Enterprise (Konnect) | OSS |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| Enterprise plugins (OIDC, OPA, Vault, mTLS) | Yes | No |
| Centralized analytics dashboard | Yes | No — use Prometheus/Grafana |
| Developer Portal | Yes | No |
| Automatic license management | Yes | N/A |
| Kong Manager UI | Full | Limited |
| **Gateway API support** | **Full** | **Full** |
| **Core plugins (rate limiting, JWT, CORS, etc.)** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

### OSS Deployment Steps

**Skip the Konnect steps** in Step 4 (steps 1, 2, 5, 6) but **still create the Gateway TLS secret** for end-to-end encryption:

1. **Generate Gateway TLS Certificates and create the secret**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/01-generate-certs.sh
   kubectl create namespace kong
   kubectl create secret tls kong-gateway-tls -n kong \
     --cert=certs/server.crt \
     --key=certs/server.key
   ```

2. **Use the OSS Helm values** (`k8s/kong/values.yaml` instead of `konnect-values.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: kong/kong    # OSS image (not kong/kong-gateway)
     tag: "3.9"

   ingressController:
     enabled: true
     # No konnect section needed

   gateway:
     env:
       database: "off"        # DB-less mode
       # No konnect_mode, cluster_*, or role settings needed
   ```

3. **Update the ArgoCD app** (`argocd/apps/02-kong-gateway.yaml`) to reference `values.yaml` instead of `konnect-values.yaml`

4. **Deploy Steps 1-3, then Step 5-6 directly** — ArgoCD will deploy Kong Gateway OSS without Konnect

> **Note:** The Gateway API resources (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute) work identically with both editions. Only the available plugin set and management capabilities differ.

---

## Appendix: Kong as an External API Management Layer

When you have APIs running on **multiple platforms** — some on Kubernetes (managed by Istio Gateway), some on EC2/ECS, some on Lambda or third-party services — deploying Kong Gateway **outside** the EKS cluster as a **centralised API management layer** gives you a single entry point with consistent policies across all backends. This pattern is useful when:

- You have **APIs hosted outside of Kubernetes** that need to be exposed and managed **alongside** K8s-hosted APIs through a **unified entry point**
- You want **one consistent API management layer** across all backends — whether they run on K8s or not — with the same authentication, rate limiting, and plugin policies
- You're already using **Istio for K8s Gateway API routing** and service mesh inside the cluster, and only need an external layer for **cross-platform API management**
- You want to keep **API management concerns separated from K8s cluster operations** — different teams can manage APIs and cluster infrastructure independently
- You need a **developer portal** and **centralized API analytics** that span both K8s and non-K8s backends
- You want **consistent API management across multi-cloud** — the same Kong config works whether your backends are on AWS, Azure, or GCP

Kong Gateway can be deployed on **separate compute (EC2/ECS) in your VPC** — outside the EKS cluster but inside your private network — with **fully private connectivity and no public endpoints**. Alternatively, Kong Konnect provides **Dedicated Cloud Gateways** — fully managed instances on Kong's infrastructure — but this introduces a public endpoint (see [deployment options](#deployment-options-for-kong-outside-the-cluster) for the security trade-offs).

> **Nothing changes inside the EKS cluster.** Istio Gateway, HTTPRoutes, and backend services remain exactly as they are. Kong sits outside as an API management layer that can front **both** K8s-hosted services (via Istio Gateway) and non-K8s services (via direct upstream routing) — giving you a single pane of glass for all your APIs regardless of where the backends run.

### Kong for API Management with Istio Gateway

The recommended approach is to deploy Kong on **separate compute in your VPC** — outside the EKS cluster but still in private subnets. CloudFront connects via **VPC Origin (PrivateLink)**, making Kong completely unreachable from the public internet:

### Deployment Options for Kong Outside the Cluster

There are **two ways** to deploy Kong as an external API management layer, and they have **very different security models** for the CloudFront → Kong link:

#### Option 1: Self-Hosted Kong in Your VPC (Truly Private — Recommended)

Deploy Kong Gateway on **EC2 instances or ECS Fargate** in your VPC's private subnets — outside the EKS cluster but still inside your network. This gives you a **fully private path with no public endpoint**, identical to how this repo's main architecture works.

            HR["HTTPRoutes"]
            Apps["Backend Services"]
        end
    end

    subgraph KonnectSaaS["Kong Konnect SaaS"]
        Analytics["Analytics & Dev Portal"]
    end

    Client -->|"TLS 1 (ACM Cert)"| CDN
    CDN --> WAF

    VPCOrigin -->|"Private<br/>(PrivateLink)"| NLB1
    NLB1 -->|"TLS 2 (Kong Cert)"| KongGW

    Plugins --> NLB2
    NLB2 --> IstioGW
    IstioGW --> HR
    HR --> Apps
    KongGW -.->|"Outbound Only"| KonnectSaaS
```

**Why this is truly private and bypass-proof:**

| Security Property | How It's Achieved |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Kong has no public endpoint** | Deployed in private subnets, no public IP, no Internet Gateway route |
| **Only CloudFront can reach Kong** | NLB 1 Security Group allows ingress **only** from CloudFront prefix list (`com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing`) |
| **Traffic never hits public internet** | CloudFront → VPC Origin (PrivateLink) → NLB 1 → Kong — all over AWS backbone |
| **Cannot bypass CloudFront** | Kong is not reachable from the internet at all. No DNS, no public IP, no public endpoint |
| **Dual TLS termination** | TLS 1 at CloudFront (ACM cert) + TLS 2 at Kong (private CA cert) — encrypted end-to-end |
| **Kong → EKS is also private** | Kong → NLB 2 → Istio Gateway — all within the same VPC, private subnets |

> **This is the same security model as this repo's main architecture** — the only difference is Kong runs on EC2/ECS instead of inside the EKS cluster. The VPC Origin + Internal NLB + Security Group pattern makes bypass **physically impossible**.

#### Option 2: Kong Konnect Dedicated Cloud Gateways (Managed by Kong)

Fully managed Kong data plane instances hosted on **Kong's infrastructure** (outside your AWS account). This is a managed service with a public endpoint — Kong provisions, scales, and maintains the gateway for you.

**The bypass problem:** Kong Cloud Gateway has a **public endpoint** (`*.gateway.konghq.com`). Someone could potentially hit Kong directly, bypassing CloudFront and WAF.

**Bypass prevention techniques:**

| Technique | How It Works | Strength |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Custom Origin Header (Shared Secret)** | CloudFront adds a secret header (e.g., `X-CF-Secret: <random-value>`) to every origin request. Kong validates it using the `request-termination` or `pre-function` plugin — rejects requests missing the header | ⭐⭐⭐ Standard approach. Secret should be rotated via Secrets Manager |
| **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** | CloudFront sends a client certificate to Kong. Kong validates the client cert before accepting the request | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cryptographic verification. Harder to spoof than headers. Requires CloudFront origin SSL client cert support |
| **IP Allowlisting** | Kong only accepts requests from CloudFront's IP ranges (published by AWS in `ip-ranges.json`) | ⭐⭐ Supplementary. CloudFront IPs are shared across all customers, so this alone isn't sufficient |
| **Kong ACL Plugin** | Combine authentication (API key / JWT) with ACL groups to restrict access to CloudFront's identity | ⭐⭐⭐ Application-layer control, managed entirely in Kong |

> **Important:** Any managed service with a public endpoint faces this challenge. The standard mitigation is the **custom origin header** pattern — CloudFront injects a secret header, and the backend validates it. Kong handles this natively with plugins.

### Comparison: Which Option Is More Secure?

| Security Aspect | Option 1: Self-Hosted in VPC | Option 2: Kong Cloud Gateway |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Kong has a public endpoint?** | No — private subnets, no public IP | Yes — `*.gateway.konghq.com` |
| **Can someone bypass CloudFront?** | Impossible — Kong is unreachable from internet | Possible without mitigation — requires shared secret header or mTLS |
| **CloudFront → Kong path** | Fully private (VPC Origin → PrivateLink → NLB) | Public HTTPS (CloudFront → Kong public endpoint) |
| **Network-level isolation** | VPC + Security Groups + no public route | Relies on application-layer controls (headers, mTLS) |
| **Bypass prevention mechanism** | Infrastructure-level (no public endpoint exists) | Application-level (shared secret header / mTLS) |
| **Operational overhead** | You manage EC2/ECS compute, patching, scaling | Kong manages everything |
| **Kong → EKS connectivity** | Same VPC — NLB in private subnets | PrivateLink / VPC Peering from Kong's infra to your VPC |

### Recommendation

| Requirement | Recommended Option |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Maximum security, no public endpoints** | Option 1 — Self-hosted Kong in VPC |
| **Regulatory/compliance (finance, healthcare)** | Option 1 — All traffic stays within your AWS account |
| **Minimal operational overhead** | Option 2 — Kong Cloud Gateway + shared secret header |
| **Fastest time to value** | Option 2 — No infrastructure to provision |
| **Multi-cloud portability** | Option 2 — Kong manages the data plane across clouds |

> **For organisations that require the same private connectivity model as this repo (no public endpoints, VPC Origin, PrivateLink), Option 1 (Self-Hosted Kong in your VPC) is the clear choice.** It gives you a fully managed-like experience via Konnect (config, analytics, dev portal) while keeping the data plane entirely within your private network — making CloudFront bypass physically impossible.

### WAF Placement

AWS WAF is attached to **CloudFront** — it filters traffic at the edge before it reaches Kong. Kong plugins handle API-specific concerns downstream. They are **complementary**, not redundant:

- **WAF at CloudFront**: OWASP Top 10, bot detection, geo-blocking, IP reputation — stops malicious traffic at the edge before it enters the VPC
- **Kong Plugins**: JWT/OAuth/OIDC authentication, per-consumer rate limiting, request transforms — handles API-specific policies requiring application context (who is the consumer, which API, what plan)

---

## Cleanup

### Automated Teardown (Recommended)

Use the destroy script for a clean, fully-automated teardown that prevents orphaned NLBs/ENIs from blocking subnet deletion:

```bash
./scripts/destroy.sh
```

The script handles the correct destruction order:
1. Deletes ArgoCD applications (cascade deletes all K8s resources via finalizers)
2. Removes any remaining LoadBalancer services that create NLBs outside Terraform
3. Cleans up K8s secrets and TargetGroupBindings
4. Detects and offers to delete orphaned NLBs in the VPC
5. Runs `terraform destroy`
6. Removes local certificate artifacts

### Manual Teardown

If you prefer manual control, follow this order:

```bash
# 1. Delete ArgoCD apps (cascade deletes K8s resources)
kubectl delete app kong-gateway-root -n argocd
sleep 60

# 2. Verify no LoadBalancer services remain (these create unmanaged NLBs)
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces | grep LoadBalancer

# 3. Destroy infrastructure
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

> **Note:** Terraform includes a pre-destroy provisioner that automatically cleans up K8s LoadBalancer services before destroying the EKS cluster. This acts as a safety net even if you skip step 1-2, but the automated script is more thorough.

<summary><h2>Kong Konnect Setup via API (KIC Split Deployment)</h2></summary>

The entire Kong Konnect integration can be configured remotely via the Konnect API — no UI interaction required after the initial one-time setup.

### Prerequisites

You only need **two things** from the Konnect UI (one-time setup). Everything else is generated during the process.

| What You Need | Where to Get It | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Personal Access Token (PAT)** | Konnect UI → Profile → Personal Access Tokens → Generate Token | Authenticates all Konnect API calls |
| **Region** | Determined when you created your Konnect account | Selects the correct API endpoint |

### Architecture

Kong is deployed as a **split deployment** — two separate Helm releases:

| Component | ArgoCD App | Helm Release | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Kong Gateway Data Plane** | `kong-gateway` | `kong-gateway` | Processes traffic (proxy on :8000/:8443, admin API on :8001) |
| **Kong Ingress Controller (KIC)** | `kong-controller` | `kong-controller` | Watches Gateway API resources, pushes config to data plane, syncs to Konnect |

```
                    Konnect API (au.kic.api.konghq.com)
                         ▲ config sync + license
                         │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  KIC (kong-controller)                          │
│  - Watches: GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute    │
│  - Auth: kong-cluster-cert TLS secret           │
└──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┘
           │ POST /config via admin API (:8001)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Kong Gateway Data Plane (2 replicas)           │
│  - Enterprise 3.9, DB-less                      │
│  - Proxy :8000 (HTTP) / :8443 (TLS)            │
│  - Admin :8001 (ClusterIP, KIC only)            │
└──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┘

```

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables and Create Control Plane

```bash
# Set your Konnect credentials (from Prerequisites above)
export KONNECT_REGION="au"          # us, eu, au, me, in, sg
export KONNECT_TOKEN="kpat_xxx..."  # Personal Access Token from Konnect UI

# Create a KIC-type Control Plane
# IMPORTANT: cluster_type is IMMUTABLE — if created wrong, you must delete and recreate
curl -s -X POST "https://${KONNECT_REGION}.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${KONNECT_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test-GW-KIC",
    "cluster_type": "CLUSTER_TYPE_K8S_INGRESS_CONTROLLER",
    "auth_type": "pki_client_certs"
  }'

# Save the Control Plane ID from the response
# Example response: { "id": "872b9828-1cd8-4f55-86f1-46059db954a3", ... }
export CONTROL_PLANE_ID="<id-from-response>"
```

> **Why `CLUSTER_TYPE_K8S_INGRESS_CONTROLLER`?** A `CLUSTER_TYPE_CONTROL_PLANE` rejects KIC sync operations with `403: You can't perform this action on a non-KIC cluster`. The cluster type tells Konnect to expect configuration pushes from KIC rather than direct data plane connections.

### Step 2: Generate TLS Client Certificates

```bash
# Generate an EC P-384 key pair (self-signed, 3-year validity)
# This certificate is used by KIC to authenticate with the Konnect API
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes \
  -newkey ec:<(openssl ecparam -name secp384r1) \
  -keyout /tmp/kic-tls.key \
  -out /tmp/kic-tls.crt \
  -days 1095 \
  -subj "/CN=konnect-Test-GW-KIC"
```

### Step 3: Register the Certificate with Konnect

```bash
# Pin the certificate to the Control Plane — Konnect will only accept connections
# from clients presenting this certificate
CERT=$(cat /tmp/kic-tls.crt | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.dumps(sys.stdin.read()))")

curl -s -X POST \
  "https://${KONNECT_REGION}.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/${CONTROL_PLANE_ID}/dp-client-certificates" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${KONNECT_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"cert\": ${CERT}}"
```

### Step 4: Create the Kubernetes TLS Secret

```bash
# Create the namespace if it doesn't exist
kubectl create namespace kong --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Store the certificate and key as a K8s TLS secret
# KIC reads this secret at runtime to authenticate with Konnect
kubectl create secret tls kong-cluster-cert -n kong \
  --cert=/tmp/kic-tls.crt \
  --key=/tmp/kic-tls.key

# Clean up temp files (cert/key now lives only in the K8s secret)
rm -f /tmp/kic-tls.crt /tmp/kic-tls.key
```

### Step 5: Configure and Deploy Kong Gateway Data Plane

File: `argocd/apps/02-kong-gateway.yaml`

This deploys Kong Gateway Enterprise as a **standalone data plane** with no controller sidecar. Key decisions:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ingressController.enabled` | `false` | KIC is deployed as a separate Helm release |
| `admin.enabled` | `true` (ClusterIP) | KIC pushes config to the data plane via admin API |
| `readinessProbe.path` | `/status` | Avoids chicken-and-egg: DB-less Kong without config returns 503 on `/status/ready`, preventing KIC from discovering pods |

```yaml
values: |
  image:
    repository: kong/kong-gateway
    tag: "3.9"

  ingressController:
    enabled: false    # KIC is a separate Helm release

  admin:
    enabled: true     # KIC connects via admin API
    type: ClusterIP
    http:
      enabled: true
      containerPort: 8001

  proxy:
    enabled: true
    type: ClusterIP
    http:
      enabled: true
      containerPort: 8000
      servicePort: 80
    tls:
      enabled: true
      containerPort: 8443
      servicePort: 443

  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /status    # NOT /status/ready (503 without config in DB-less mode)
      port: status
      scheme: HTTP

  replicaCount: 2
```

### Step 6: Configure and Deploy KIC with Konnect Integration

File: `argocd/apps/02b-kong-controller.yaml`

This deploys KIC as a **standalone controller** that watches Gateway API resources, pushes config to the data plane via admin API, and syncs everything to Konnect. Key decisions:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `deployment.kong.enabled` | `false` | No Kong proxy sidecar — data plane is separate |
| `konnect.runtimeGroupID` | `<your-cp-id>` | Helm chart parameter name (not `controlPlaneID`) |
| `konnect.apiHostname` | `au.kic.api.konghq.com` | Region-specific KIC API endpoint |
| `konnect.license.enabled` | `true` | Auto-fetches Enterprise license from Konnect |
| `publish_service` | `kong/kong-gateway-kong-proxy` | Must point to the **data plane's** proxy service, not KIC's |
| `gatewayDiscovery.adminApiService` | `kong-gateway-kong-admin` | Discovers data plane pods via admin API service |

```yaml
values: |
  deployment:
    kong:
      enabled: false       # No Kong proxy sidecar

  ingressController:
    enabled: true
    installCRDs: false     # CRDs installed separately
    env:
      feature_gates: "GatewayAlpha=true"
      publish_service: "kong/kong-gateway-kong-proxy"
    konnect:
      enabled: true
      runtimeGroupID: "<your-control-plane-id>"    # from Step 1
      apiHostname: "au.kic.api.konghq.com"         # from Prerequisites table
      tlsClientCertSecretName: "kong-cluster-cert"  # from Step 4
      license:
        enabled: true
    gatewayDiscovery:
      enabled: true
      adminApiService:
        name: "kong-gateway-kong-admin"    # Data plane's admin service
        namespace: "kong"
```

### Step 7: Verify

```bash
# 1. Check all pods are running (2x data plane + 1x KIC)
kubectl get pods -n kong

# 2. Check KIC is syncing config to data plane pods
kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kong-controller --tail=10 | grep "Successfully synced"
# Expected: "Successfully synced configuration to Kong"

# 3. Check Konnect sync is working
kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kong-controller --tail=10 | grep "Konnect"
# Expected: "Successfully synced configuration to Konnect"

# 4. Check nodes registered in Konnect via API
curl -s "https://${KONNECT_REGION}.api.konghq.com/v2/control-planes/${CONTROL_PLANE_ID}/nodes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${KONNECT_TOKEN}" | python3 -m json.tool
# Expected: 3 nodes (1 ingress-controller + 2 kong-proxy)

# 5. Verify Gateway API resources (zero classical Ingress resources)
kubectl get gatewayclasses,gateways,httproutes -A
kubectl get ingress -A   # Should return "No resources found"
```

### Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `403: non-KIC cluster` | CP created as `CLUSTER_TYPE_CONTROL_PLANE` | Delete CP and recreate with `CLUSTER_TYPE_K8S_INGRESS_CONTROLLER` (type is immutable) |
| `401: not authorized` | Certificate not registered with the CP, or wrong CP ID | Re-register cert via Step 3, or verify `runtimeGroupID` matches CP ID from Step 1 |
| `role: data_plane` disables admin API | Kong in `data_plane` mode ignores admin API settings | Do **not** set `role: data_plane` when using KIC — KIC needs the admin API |
| KIC CrashLoopBackOff on `:8444` | Data plane pods not Ready, admin API not in endpoints | Override readiness probe to `/status` instead of `/status/ready` |
| `controlPlaneID` not recognized | Helm chart uses a different parameter name | Change to `runtimeGroupID` in Helm values |
| `gatewayDiscovery` not found | Must be nested under `ingressController`, not at top level | Indent correctly under `ingressController:` |
| KIC expects wrong proxy service | KIC defaults to `kong-controller-kong-proxy` | Set `publish_service: "kong/kong-gateway-kong-proxy"` in KIC env |
